“Source Code” means the source code for the Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard.

“Specification” means the specification for the Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard. Notwithstanding the foregoing, “Specification” shall not include (i) the implementation of other published specifications referenced in the Specification; (ii) any enabling technologies that may be necessary to make or use any product or portion thereof that complies with the Specification, but are not themselves expressly set forth in this Specification (e.g. compiler front ends, code generators, back ends, libraries or other compiler, assembler or linker technologies; validation or debug software or hardware; applications, operating system or driver software; RISC architecture; processor microarchitecture); (iii) maskworks and physical layouts of integrated circuit designs; or (iv) RTL or other high level representations of integrated circuit designs.


LICENCE GRANTS
1.  Subject to the provisions of Clauses 2, 3, 4 and 5, ARM hereby grants to you under any intellectual property that is (a) owned or freely licensable by ARM without payment to unaffiliated third parties and (b) either embodied in either or both the Source Code and Specification, as applicable, or Necessary (defined in Clause 4 below) to copy or implement an applications binary interface compliant with the Specification, a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty free, worldwide licence to:

Except as specifically licensed in accordance with Clause 1, you acquire no right, title or interest in the Source Code and Specification or any intellectual property embodied therein. In no event shall the licences granted in accordance with Clause 1 be construed as granting you, expressly or by implication, estoppel or otherwise, a licence to use any ARM technology except the Source Code and Specification. 
Except as provided in Clause 1, no right is granted to you to sublicense the rights granted to you under this Licence.
3.  THE SOURCE CODE AND SPECIFICATION ARE PROVIDED "AS IS".

In this Licence; (i) "affiliate" means any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with a party (in fact or in law, via voting securities, management control or otherwise) and "affiliated" shall be construed accordingly; (ii) "assert" means to allege infringement in legal or administrative proceedings, or proceedings before any other competent trade, arbitral or international authority; (iii) “Necessary” means with respect to any claims of any patent, those claims which, without the appropriate permission of the patent owner, will be infringed when implementing the Specification because no alternative, commercially reasonable, non-infringing way of implementing the Specification is known; and (iv) English law and the jurisdiction of the English courts shall apply to all aspects of this Licence, its interpretation and enforcement. 
5.  No licence, express, implied or otherwise, is granted to you, under the provisions of Clause 1, to use the ARM tradename, in connection with either or both the Source Code and the Specification or any products based thereon.
